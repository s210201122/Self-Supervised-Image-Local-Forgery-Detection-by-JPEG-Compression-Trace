## Self-Supervised Image Local Forgery Detection by JPEG Compression Trace

### 1. Changing the path in mian.py can test different datasetsï¼›



### 2. Changing the path in the checkpoint file in the. checkpoint folder can get results for different stages, while changing to 'extractor tensorflow-0' can get the output of JPEG compression extractor;



### 3.  Due to the characteristics of different datasets, different parameters need to be tried during the binarization process to achieve the results in the paper. Of course, if you have a better binarization method, you can try it.
